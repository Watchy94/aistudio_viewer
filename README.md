Hi there,


I have modified this script to include a "download with thinking" button :
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/554502-google-ai-studio-conversation-chat-markdown-export-download-dom-based

The modified version of the script you should use is the file "script_3.7.txt".
Then you can use the viewer "aistudio_viewer_v1.html", it's a simple app in html, so you just open it.

That's my first public coded thing and tried my best to have a good enough UI, so i hope some people will find it useful !
