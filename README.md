Hi there,

It's a markdown viewer for Google AI Studio exports.

1 . Exporting
So how do you export first? By installing "https://violentmonkey.github.io/" extension on your browser
Then you add the content of the file "script_3.7.txt" as a new code in this extension and activate it.
That script is a modified version from https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/554502-google-ai-studio-conversation-chat-markdown-export-download-dom-based

You will have two new button in google ai studio to export (one without "thinking" and one with)

2. Using the markdown viewer
You download the file "aistudio_viewer_v1.html", it's a simple app in html, so you just open it.


That's my first public coded thing and tried my best to have a good enough UI, so i hope some people will find it useful !
